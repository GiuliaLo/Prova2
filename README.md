# SmartNotebook

Capstone Project for CS major at Westminster College.

Android app that aims to improve the note taking experience for students who take notes on paper. It allows them to link digital content to their notes by associating the desired file with a number that they will write on the page, and retrieve it pointing their smartphone's camera at it, in a way similar to how QR codes work. The app uses OCR to recognize the number and open the appropriate file, that had been previously uploaded to the app.
